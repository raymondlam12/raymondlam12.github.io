                        <h3>A Tip For Writing Waterloo's AIF</h3>

                        <h5 class="bottom-margin">December 24, 2018</h5>

                        <p>When I wrote the first draft of my application for Software Engineering at Waterloo, I thought I had crafted a classical literature. I learned a few rhetorical devices in high school and thought my analogy comparing myself to a Magikarp that could evolve into a Gyarados by learning and growing at Waterloo was awfully clever. I also added alliteration any way I could because I thought I’d get style points. But I knew something was wrong when I asked for a peer review and their reply began with, “take this with a grain of salt, but...”. They reviewed my application and my primary take-away was the following:</p>

                        <h4>Be Specific</h4>

                        <p>The main questions I had to answer in my application were:</p>

                        <p>1. Reasons for choosing your program and Waterloo. Please tell us about your educational goals, your interest in your chosen program(s), and your reasons for applying to the University of Waterloo. If you have applied to more than one program please discuss your interest in each program. (900 character limit)</p>

                        <p>2. Briefly explain why you are interested in engineering and particularly in the program to which you have applied. Comment, for example, on your interests and abilities; your career goals; exposure to engineering through school-related and other experiences; and discussions you have had with engineers, teachers, current or past Waterloo students.  (900 character limit)</p>

                        <p>My initial draft was essentially filled with fluff. Instead of explaining these questions, I compared Waterloo to an Exp. Share where I learn from the experiences of my peers to evolve despite having no means of leveling up as a Magikarp that only knows Splash.</p>

                        <p>It is very important to specifically explain and quantify a point that you bring up on your application. For example, I remember in my initial draft, I stated that I had experience with engineering-related activities by participating in my school’s robotics team. At the time, I believed that breadth was more important and tried to overload as many vague engineering experiences as possible in 900 characters.</p>

                        <p>I realized afterwards that it was vital to specifically describe my role and impact on the team. I revised my application and explained my primary responsibilities on the robotics team. I explained the specific type of tasks and aspects of the robot I was working on. I also explained my areas of improvement, lesssons learned and growth as a teammate through this experience. Due to the 900 character limit, I had to remove many other vaguely explained thoughts which was probably a blessing in disguise.</p>
